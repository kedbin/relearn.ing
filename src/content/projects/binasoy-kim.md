## The Objective

This project serves as the foundational "Base of Operations" for my digital presence. Unlike `relearn.ing`, which focuses on the *process* of cognitive architecture, `binasoy.kim` is the *identity* layer—the "Who" behind the "How."

## The Philosophy: Continuous Iteration

The core philosophy of this site is the "Continuous Journey." It is not a static resume; it is a living document of:
1.  **Learning:** Acquiring new cloud and AI capabilities.
2.  **Unlearning:** Discarding outdated practices and limiting beliefs.
3.  **Relearning:** Optimizing workflows with new tools.

## The Stack: Back to Basics

While `relearn.ing` uses the modern Island Architecture of Astro, `binasoy.kim` was built with a fundamental appreciation for the core web technologies:

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
*   **SCSS:** Modular styling with variables and nesting, compiled to optimized CSS.
*   **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS for lightweight interactions, minimizing bundle bloat.
*   **Webpack:** For efficient asset bundling and build optimization.

## Engineering The Identity

The site is designed to be a high-performance landing zone. By avoiding heavy frameworks for this specific layer, I ensure:
*   **Zero-Latency Load Times:** Crucial for first impressions.
*   **Universal Compatibility:** Runs effectively on any device or browser without hydration overhead.
*   **Maintainability:** A simple codebase that doesn't suffer from "framework rot."

It stands as a testament to the idea that sometimes, the best engineering solution is the simplest one.
