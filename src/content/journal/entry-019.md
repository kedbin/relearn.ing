Dr. Matt Hill, a PhD researcher who applies economic theory to human behavior, recently shared a personal observation that crystallized something I've been thinking about:

> "I just got back from vacation... 2 weeks of buffets and Belgian beer made me gain about 5 to 10 lbs. I'm going to lose it... but the 'fleeting blissful moments' of snacks are equivalent to a half hour on the treadmill."

Society treats physical health as a moral failing. We are told we lack "discipline" or "motivation." This is a fundamental categorization error. Your body is not a moral agent; it is a biological market seeking equilibrium. Dr. Hill's framing rejects the battle-against-temptation narrative. It is simply a mismanagement of Input/Output variables and Utility functions. The "vacation weight" is not a sin; it is merely an inventory surplus resulting from unmonitored metrics.

To solve this, we do not need "willpower"; we need Economic Policy. What follows is my synthesis of Dr. Hill's framework through the relearn.ing lens.

## The Fallacy: The Willpower Doctrine

The legacy model treats weight management as a character test. You either have the discipline to resist, or you are weak. This framing is worse than useless—it actively impedes progress.

The reality: your biology evolved in an environment of scarcity. The systems that reward caloric consumption are not bugs; they were features for survival. Operating a modern human in a post-scarcity food environment without quantified feedback is like running a 2026 application on hardware optimized for 10,000 BCE.

The fallacy is believing that raw determination can override evolved neurochemistry. It cannot. You need systems, not sermons.

## The Model: Three Economic Principles for Biological Systems

### The GDP Protocol (Data Visibility)

In the 1930s, the concept of "The Economy" didn't exist as a measurable entity until Simon Kuznets developed methods to measure National Income [1]. Before measurement, there was only chaos. You cannot optimize a system that runs in the dark.

Your body is a closed economy. Most humans operate their biological economy like a failed state—printing currency (calories) without tracking inflation (fat storage). The feeling of "laziness" or "hunger" is often just noise. The signal is the data. If you are not operating in a verified calorie deficit (2500 kcal limit, for example), you are not "dieting"; you are gambling.

You must become the Central Bank of your own physiology.

### The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

The first slice of pizza is heaven; the sixth is regret. Economists have long understood that the utility (satisfaction) derived from consuming a good decreases with each additional unit consumed. This is Gossen's First Law. The user chases the high of the first bite (Input A), but by unit 10, the return on investment is negligible.

You are solving for Satiety, not Flavour. The hack is to manipulate the "satiety index." By front-loading low-utility, high-volume inputs (e.g., steamed broccoli) before the high-utility inputs, you mechanically lower the marginal utility of the junk food. You aren't denying yourself the pizza; you are simply crashing the market value of the pizza before it enters the system.

### The Coase Theorem and Transaction Costs

In economics, transaction costs are the "friction" required to make a trade. Companies like Uber reduced friction to make spending money easier. To optimize health, we must inverse this. We must engineer High Friction for maladaptive behaviors [2].

If a snack requires walking to the store, buying it, and opening it, the "cost" is high. If it is sitting on your desk, the cost is near zero. The strategy of intentionally forgetting a wallet or hiding snacks is a brilliant application of Architectural Friction. You must design an environment where being unhealthy is logistically difficult.

## The Protocol: A Framework for Bio-Economic Restructuring

Theory is useless without execution. We must move from "trying" to "architecting."

### Phase 1: The Audit (Establish the Ledger)

Determine your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). For 7 days, track every single input. Do not change your diet yet. Just observe. You are establishing the "Gross Domestic Product" of your body.

- **The Metric:** If Input > Output, you have an inflation problem.

### Phase 2: The Friction Architecture (Supply Side Reform)

Increase Transaction Costs for high-caloric inputs.

- **The Wallet Protocol:** Do not carry payment methods to work if your office has a vending machine.
- **The Visual Barrier:** Place all high-calorie foods in opaque containers on high shelves. Place low-calorie foods (broccoli, water) in clear containers at eye level.
- **The Pre-Commitment:** Create a social contract. Tell a peer you will pay them $100 if you fail to hit a metric. This leverages Loss Aversion [3].

### Phase 3: The Temptation Bundle (Demand Curve Manipulation)

Lower the "shadow price" of exercise by bundling it with high-dopamine activities [4].

- **Action:** Select a media consumption habit you love (e.g., surfing videos, podcasts, Netflix). Create a hard rule: You are only allowed to consume this content while your heart rate is above 120 BPM.
- **Effect:** You are effectively subsidizing the cost of labor (exercise) with entertainment utility.

## The Takeaway

The struggle is not unique; it is a predictable outcome of a biological machine operating in a post-scarcity environment. By applying the laws of economics—quantification, friction, and utility—we can bypass the unreliable nature of human willpower.

The future self is the enemy of the present self until you align their incentives.
