  I used to study until I "felt ready." Exercise until I "had enough." Scroll until I was "done."

  No criteria. No thresholds. Just vibes.

  And every time, the same result: guilt from stopping too early, or diminishing returns from pushing too long.

  Then I found the math. Turns out scientists have spent decades mapping exactly when to stop:

  → 90 minutes: Your brain's ultradian rhythm. After that, it's garbage time.
  → 7.5 hours: Sleep in 90-min cycles. "8 hours" wakes you mid-cycle, groggy.
  → 45-60 min: Intense training window before cortisol spikes eat your gains.
  → 80/20: The final polish costs 80% of effort for 20% of value.

  When you "play by ear," you're not accessing wisdom. You're running a search algorithm without a break statement.

  Optimization isn't about doing more. It's about knowing exactly when to stop.

  No criteria. Just vibes. And every time: guilt or diminishing returns.

  Scientists mapped the stopping points decades ago. 90-min focus cycles. Sleep in 7.5-hour blocks. 45-60 min workout windows.

  "Playing by ear" isn't wisdom. It's a search algorithm without a break statement.

There is a deep pitfall in "playing by ear." It feels like freedom—the ability to pivot, to adapt, to stop when it "feels right." But in a system with finite resources, an open loop is not a feature; it is a bug.

I noticed this pattern in my own routines. Studying until I "felt ready." Exercising until I "had enough." Scrolling until I "was done." No criteria. No thresholds. Just vibes. And every time, the same result: either I stopped too early (guilt) or pushed too long (diminishing returns). I was running processes without exit conditions.

As I wrote in my notes: *"There must come a time where all efforts must have been exhausted and there is no longer any reason to continue with the action... If you don't set it, then you are robbing yourself."*

The question is not whether to stop. The question is: do you have a rule for when?

## The Fallacy: Infinite Intuition

We believe our bodies know. We trust the feeling of "done." We assume that instinct will signal when the task has yielded its value.

This is the **Infinite Intuition Fallacy**. It assumes your internal signals are calibrated to modern life. They are not.

Your body evolved to forage, flee, and reproduce. It did not evolve to optimize study sessions, manage sleep cycles in artificial light, or know when a spreadsheet is "good enough." As Daniel Kahneman noted: "Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition" [1]. If you have never been trained on the optimal stopping point, you cannot recognize it. You are pattern-matching against data you do not have.

When you "play by ear," you are not accessing wisdom. You are running a search algorithm without a break statement—hoping the loop will terminate on its own.

## The Model: Stopping Rules for Daily Systems

The mathematics of optimal stopping are well-established. The **Secretary Problem**, formalized by Lindley in 1961, proves that for sequential decisions, you should sample 37% of your options to calibrate, then commit to the first option that exceeds your threshold [2]. But this framework, typically applied to hiring or housing, scales down to the mundane.

Every daily task is a search problem: *How much effort yields the best return?* The answer is never "as much as possible." The answer is a threshold.

### The 90-Minute Focus Cycle

Your brain does not maintain steady-state concentration. It operates on **Ultradian Rhythms**—biological waves of approximately 90 minutes identified by sleep researcher Nathaniel Kleitman [3].

K. Anders Ericsson's research on elite performers found that violinists practiced in sessions of no more than 90 minutes and rarely exceeded 4 hours of total deep work per day [4]. Beyond this, practice quality degraded. They were accumulating time, not skill.

**The Stopping Rule:** After 90 minutes of focused work, the next hour is garbage time. Stop. Rest. Resume.

### The Sleep Cycle Threshold

Sleep is not "the more the better." Epidemiological studies show a **U-shaped mortality curve**: both under-sleeping (<6 hours) and over-sleeping (>9 hours) correlate with higher cardiovascular risk and cognitive decline [5].

Sleep occurs in 90-minute cycles. Waking mid-cycle triggers **sleep inertia**—severe grogginess that can last hours. Waking at the end of a cycle (after 7.5 or 9 hours) capitalizes on the brain's natural arousal state.

**The Stopping Rule:** Sleep in multiples of 90 minutes. Do not set an alarm for "8 hours"—set it for 7.5 or 9. And do not oversleep; those extra hours are not depositing energy—they are withdrawing from your waking capacity.

### The Good Enough Plateau

Nobel laureate Herbert Simon coined **satisficing**—the rational strategy of stopping as soon as criteria are met, rather than searching for the optimal [6]. Barry Schwartz extended this: "Maximizers" (those who seek the absolute best) are consistently less satisfied than "Satisficers" (those with a threshold for "good enough") [7].

This applies to dishes, emails, and the fifth adjustment in the mirror.

**The Stopping Rule:** Define "acceptable" before you begin. The Pareto Principle suggests 20% of effort yields 80% of results. For daily tasks, the final polish is not worth the time it costs.

### The Workout Hormone Window

In physical training, more is not better after a threshold. Research shows that after 45-60 minutes of intense resistance training, cortisol spikes while testosterone plateaus [8]. Continuing past this point does not build muscle—it extends recovery.

**The Stopping Rule:** 45-60 minutes for intense training. The minimum effective dose, not the maximum tolerable dose.

## The Protocol: Algorithmic Living

The framework is simple. For any recurring task, define three things before you begin:

**1. The Boundary (N)**
How long will you allocate? How many iterations? This is non-negotiable.

- Study session: 90 minutes
- Workout: 50 minutes  
- Email triage: 30 minutes
- Sleep: 7.5 hours (5 cycles)

**2. The Threshold (Good Enough)**
What does "done" look like? Not perfect—functional.

- Dishes: ready for next use
- Hair: acceptable for context
- Draft: ready for feedback, not publication

**3. The Trigger (Exit Condition)**
When the boundary is hit OR the threshold is met—whichever comes first—you stop. No negotiation. No "just five more minutes."

This is what psychologist Peter Gollwitzer calls **Implementation Intentions**: "If X, then Y" [9]. The rule offloads the decision. You are not asking "Do I feel like stopping?" You are asking "Has the condition been met?"

## The Disservice of Playing by Ear

Here is the uncomfortable truth.

Generations of scientists have dedicated their lives to understanding how systems optimize under constraints. Kleitman mapped ultradian rhythms. Simon proved bounded rationality. Ericsson quantified deliberate practice limits. Walker decoded sleep architecture. This knowledge exists. It is available. It is precise.

And yet, we wake up and "see how we feel." We study "until it clicks." We exercise "until we're tired." We scroll "for just a few more minutes."

This is not intuition. This is ignorance wearing the mask of spontaneity.

When you operate without defined exit conditions, you are not living freely—you are living *primitively*. You are discarding the cumulative discoveries of data-driven humanity and reverting to the heuristics of organisms that had no choice but to play by ear.

You have a choice. The science exists. To ignore it is not neutrality; it is negligence toward yourself.

## The Meta-Lesson

Optimization is not about doing more. It is about knowing exactly when to stop.

The hours you reclaim by honoring your thresholds—those are not wasted potential. They are the dividend of respecting your own constraints. They are time returned to you by the scientists who mapped the territory so you would not have to wander.

Use the map.
