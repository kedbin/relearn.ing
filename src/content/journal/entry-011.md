## The Introduction

Every year, millions of biological machines (humans) attempt to reprogram their source code on January 1st. By February, statistical models show that approximately 80 percent of these reprogramming attempts fail [1]. The societal norm is to blame this on a lack of "willpower" or "grit."

At **Relearn.ing**, we reject this hypothesis. Willpower is a fluctuating resource, subject to fatigue and glucose levels. Relying on it is poor system design.

A recent journal entry offered a superior hypothesis: the mind is not defective; it is simply an energy-conserving system that requires **constraints** to function efficiently. As the author notes:

> "I presume this is just the nature of the brain—without a framework and constraint to bound it, then it reverts back to what is easy and returns to the status quo."

To solve this, we must pivot from "Aspiring" (a passive emotional state) to "Architecting" (an active engineering state). We will explore this through the lens of **Vector Calculus** and **Pre-commitment Theory**.

## 1. The Physics of Fickleness: Biological Entropy

**The Insight:**

> "The human mind is fickle, and left to its own devices rarely commits to its promises... it reverts back to what is easy."

**The Science:**

In thermodynamics, **Entropy** is the measure of disorder in a system. The Second Law states that isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium—the state of maximum entropy. In a biological context, "equilibrium" is the path of least resistance. It is the couch, the junk food, and the mindless scrolling.

Your brain follows the **Free Energy Principle** (proposed by neuroscientist Karl Friston [2]). It seeks to minimize surprise and metabolic cost. "Reverting to the status quo" is simply your brain optimizing for energy conservation. Fickleness is not a bug; it is a feature designed for survival in a calorie-scarce environment.

**The Synthesis:**

To change behavior, you are fighting the physics of your own biology. You cannot win this fight with "motivation," because motivation is high-energy and transient. You can only win by altering the **Potential Energy Landscape**. You must make the "good" behavior lower energy (easier) and the "bad" behavior higher energy (harder) through external structures.

## 2. Scalars vs. Vectors: The Trajectory Problem

**The Insight:**

> "In addition to thinking in trajectories, where you must look not only at the magnitude but also the direction of the task..."

**The Science:**

Most New Year's resolutions are **Scalars**. A scalar is a quantity having only magnitude, not direction (e.g., "I want to work harder" or "I want to read more").

However, success is a **Vector**. A vector quantity requires both magnitude *and* direction.

If you apply massive magnitude (effort) in the wrong direction, your displacement from your goal remains zero—or worse, negative. This is why "hustle culture" often leads to burnout without progress. You are spinning wheels (high speed) without traction (zero velocity).

**The Synthesis:**

The journal author correctly identifies "Thinking in Trajectories." A trajectory is a path followed by an object moving under the action of given forces. To maintain a trajectory, you cannot rely on the initial push (the New Year's resolution). You need a guidance system that constantly corrects the vector.

## 3. The Architecture of Constraint: Odyssean Pacts

**The Insight:**

> "You would only be able to think in trajectories if a framework imposes a constraint that is followed... A structure is needed so that it is followed."

**The Science:**

In Game Theory and Behavioral Economics, this concept is known as a **Pre-commitment Device**, often called an "Ulysses Pact."

In *The Odyssey*, Ulysses knows he cannot resist the Sirens' song (the "fickle mind"). He does not rely on willpower. Instead, he orders his men to tie him to the mast (the "constraint").

Renowned social scientist Jon Elster argues that rationality is the ability to bind one's future self [3]. A "Framework" acts as the mast. It artificially increases the **Friction Costs** of deviating from the trajectory.

**The Synthesis:**

Freedom is often counter-productive to progress. A river flows with force only because it is constrained by its banks. Remove the banks (constraints), and the water spreads out, becomes a swamp, and stagnates. To achieve your trajectory, you must build the banks that force your energy to flow in a specific direction.

## The Application: The Vector Alignment Protocol

Theory is useless without execution. To implement the "Thinking in Trajectories" model for the New Year, utilize the following three-phase protocol.

### Phase 1: The Vector Audit (Diagnosis)

Stop setting "Goals" (Scalars). Start setting "Vectors."

1.  **Define the Destination Coordinates:** Where exactly do you want to be in 365 days? Be specific (e.g., "Write 50,000 words of code," not "Learn to code").
2.  **Calculate the Required Velocity:** To write 50,000 words in a year, the required velocity is approximately 137 words per day.
3.  **Identify Vector Mismatches:** Look at your current daily habits. Are they vectors pointing toward the destination, or are they orthogonal (sideways)?

### Phase 2: The Constraint Architecture (Intervention)

Build the "Ulysses Pact" to bind your future fickle self.

*   **High-Friction Barriers (For Bad Vectors):**
    *   *Digital:* Use app blockers that cannot be disabled during work hours.
    *   *Physical:* Remove batteries from the TV remote; unplug the console. Increase the activation energy required to engage in entropy.

*   **Low-Friction Channels (For Good Vectors):**
    *   *Environmental Design:* If the goal is gym, sleep in gym clothes. If the goal is writing, leave the IDE open and the internet disconnected before you sleep. Reduce the activation energy to near zero.

### Phase 3: The Feedback Loop (Implementation)

A trajectory requires constant course correction.

*   **The Weekly Review (PID Controller):**
    *   Treat your weekly review as a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller**.
    *   *Error Calculation:* Difference between Expected Progress and Actual Progress.
    *   *Correction:* If you are behind, do not just "try harder" (Scalar). Adjust the constraints (Vector). If you did not write, was the phone too accessible? Tighten the constraint.

## Conclusion

The journal entry asks: *"What is the solution to seeing a resolution through?"*

The solution is the abandonment of "resolution" in favor of "architecture." The mind is a fluid; it takes the shape of the container you pour it into. If you want to change the shape of your life, do not talk to the fluid. **Build a better container.**

> "Discipline is not a character trait. It is a system of constraints that makes the desired behavior inevitable."
