        Hey, I'm Kim Edrian Binasoy.

        Cloud Engineer. AI Enthusiast. Builder of Relearn.ing.

        <p>
          I spent 4 years architecting automation for banks and transportation networks. I built systems that scaled, deployed Gen-AI bots to streamline knowledge transfer, and optimized workflows for hundreds of employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>But I couldn't automate my own habits.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          By day, I was a disciplined engineer. By night, my personal operating system was a mess of half-started projects and "productivity tools" that only added friction. I became a <strong>Tool Collector</strong>, hoarding AI agents like infinity stones, hoping they would magically fix my output.
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn't. I had the best tech stack in the world, but I lacked the <em>system</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Relearn.ing</strong> is my open-source attempt to fix that. It is not a blog; it is a documentation of debugging my own habits. It is the application of enterprise-grade engineering discipline—observability, refactoring, and automation—to the messy reality of being human.
