# Relearn.ing: Deployment & Content Guide

## 1. Website Downtime Investigation
**Issue:** The website was loading a blank page with a console error about `index.tsx` and MIME types.
**Root Cause:** GitHub Pages was configured to serve the **source code** (from the `main` branch) instead of the **built application** (from the `gh-pages` branch). Browsers cannot execute raw TypeScript/JSX files.
**Solution:** We updated the GitHub Pages settings to serve from the `gh-pages` branch. This branch contains the compiled, production-ready code generated by your CI/CD pipeline.

## 2. Journal Navigation Issue
**Issue:** You cannot click "Read log" to view a full journal entry.
**Root Cause:** The "Read log" element in the UI was purely cosmetic. The application lacked:
1.  **Routing State:** No way to track which specific entry is currently selected.
2.  **Single Entry View:** No component designed to display a single, full-length article.
3.  **Click Handlers:** The buttons were not wired up to any navigation logic.
**Status:** I am currently implementing the fix for this. I will add a "Single Entry" view and wire up the navigation.

## 3. Deployment Workflow
Your project is set up with **Continuous Deployment** via GitHub Actions.

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1.  **Commit & Push:** Simply push your changes to the `main` branch.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: add new journal entry"
    git push origin main
    ```
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   GitHub detects the push.
    *   The `deploy-gh-pages.yml` workflow runs automatically.
    *   It builds your site (`npm run build`).
    *   It deploys the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.
3.  **Live Site:** The changes will appear on `https://relearn.ing` within a few minutes.

### Manual Verification
You can check the status of deployments in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/kedbin/relearn.ing/actions) of your repository.

## 4. Adding New Content (Journal Entries)
To add a new journal entry, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the Content
1.  Navigate to `src/data/journal/`.
2.  Create a new Markdown file (e.g., `entry-002.md`).
3.  Write your content. (Note: Currently, the system imports the *text* content. Ensure your `index.ts` handles the import correctly).

### Step 2: Register the Entry
1.  Open `src/data/journal/index.ts`.
2.  Import your new markdown file (if you are using raw markdown imports) or simply add a new object to the `journalEntries` array.
3.  The structure should look like this:
    ```typescript
    {
      id: 'entry-002',
      title: 'Your New Title',
      date: 'Nov 20, 2025',
      status: 'Published',
      summary: 'A brief summary for the card view...',
      highlights: ['Highlight 1', 'Highlight 2'],
      content: `...your full markdown content or imported string...`
    }
    ```

### Step 3: Push
Commit and push your changes. The site will update automatically.
