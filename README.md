# relearn.ing | Rewrite Your Playbook

An honest build log from an entry-to-mid level cloud engineer relearning life, tooling, and AI workflows in public.

## About

This is the public documentation of my journey from AI tool hoarder to actually shipping code with AI assistance. No hype, just honest metrics, failed prompts, and the occasional victory.

### The Vision
- **Stop consuming tutorials, start building**
- **Document failures so others can skip my wasted hours**
- **Measure actual velocity gains, not potential**

### The Three Pillars
1. **Relearn Life**: Breaking the tutorial addiction and building sustainable systems
2. **Relearn Cloud**: Turning AI from a toy into a teammate for actual deployment tasks
3. **Relearn AI**: Teaching the failure, not the success

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Deploy

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Lucide React** for icons
