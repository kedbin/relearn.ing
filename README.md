# relearn.ing | The Public Log of a Recovering Perfectionist

> "I spent 4 years architecting automation for banks and transportation networks. But I couldn't automate my own habits."

This repository is **not** a tutorial. It is a **living artifact** of my attempt to apply enterprise-grade engineering discipline to the messy reality of being human.

It serves as the public documentation of my journey from "AI Tool Collector" to actually shipping code. It is an open-source commitment to transparency, documenting the failures, the wasted hours, and the eventual breakthroughs.

## The Mission: The Engineer's Paradox

I built reliable, fault-tolerant systems for a living. Yet, my personal operating system was a mess of half-started projects and "productivity tools" that only added friction.

**Relearn.ing** is the patch.

- **The Goal**: To debug sleep, focus, and decision-making as if they were mission-critical infrastructure.
- **The Method**: Treat personal growth as a CI/CD pipeline. Commit, test, deploy, monitor, repeat.
- **The Promise**: No hype. Just honest metrics. If a prompt failed, I'll log it. If an agent hallucinated, I'll document it.

## The Stack (The Toolkit)

I use these tools not because they are trendy, but because they provide the **leverage** I need to ship faster.

- **Astro v5**: For performance and content-driven architecture.
- **React 19**: For interactive islands where complexity is justified.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development without context switching.
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous deployment and accountability.

## Transparency

This repository is public because **accountability is a feature**. By building in public, I force myself to ship "v0.1.0" habits instead of waiting for "v1.0" perfection.

You are free to fork this, critique it, or use it as a template for your own relearning journey.
